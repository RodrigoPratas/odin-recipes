    To start this recipe, prepare the sauce: peel the onion, chop it coarsely, put it in a pan, add the margarine and the bay leaf, bring to the boil and cook until golden. Add the tomato pulp, beef stock and beer and bring to a boil. Dissolve the cornflour in a little milk and add it to the pan, in thread, stirring constantly. Rectify the salt, season with spice, stir, add the brandy and Port Wine and bring to a boil. Pass through the mesh strainer and return to a low heat to warm up.
    Cut the sausages in half, then in half lengthwise again and season with salt and pepper. Also cut the sausages in the same way. Also season the steaks with salt and pepper. Grill the steaks, sausages and sausage to taste.
    Lightly toast the slices of bread and distribute two slices on two plates. Cover with a slice of ham, then add the steak and place another slice of bread. Then add the sausage and sausage, cover with a slice of cheese and the rest of the bread. Then add three slices of cheese on top of each set, bake at 200°C until melted, remove and serve hot drizzled with the sauce.
